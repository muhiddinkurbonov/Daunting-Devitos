/*

problem:
  a REST API is stateless, so there's no way to have a "timer" for game phases.
  this could lead to a long delay if a player never moves.

solution (the realistic one):
  use something like Redis pub/sub to broadcast a delayed message that acts as a timer

solution (the hacky one):
  have the initial request handler that started the betting phase start a timer and trigger the next game phase
  (this could be brittle if the server crashes or restarts)

solution (the funny one):
  have a "hurry up" button that triggers the next game phase if the time is past the deadline
  (could be combined with prev, but could lead to a race condition)
